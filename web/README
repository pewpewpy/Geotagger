Demonstration of what you can do with your location history data which you can get as JSON file via Google Takeout (https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/location_history).

Before you can use this with your data you will have to use the location_history_json_converter (https://github.com/Scarygami/location-history-json-converter) with the following parameters:

location_history_json_converter.py LocationHistory.json -f js -o input.js

Replace the input.js in this repository with the input.js you created like this.

Then just open the index.html in a browser of your choice (tested in Chrome only...)
